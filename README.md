This website was developed as a part of my assignments. HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL are some of the few things we've been taught until now and we had to put all our skills to practice. This was my first large scale website, a complete project. I'm glad that it was very appreciated by the faculty and my classmates.<br/>
For modern standards, this website might not be too good but it is definitely something I'm proud of, especially as a beginner. I've been able to integrate and make use of modern technologies and this project made me confident enough that now, I'll be able to take on any project without hesitation. I've learnt that it isn't important to know everything but it is important to learn how to know everything and undertake challenges to keep growing.<br/>
